## Project Description

The goal of this project was to evaluate some of the UK Food Standards Agency ratings for restaurants in the UK for the food magazine, <i>Eat Safe, Love</i>. A json file containing the data on restaurants was imported to MongoDB using a command prompt window. From there, data cleaning and eventual data analysis were completed in a jupyter notebook using the PyMongo library.'
